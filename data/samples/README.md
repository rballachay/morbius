# Slot Filling Dataset

Joint intent-classification/slot-filling datasets are typically stored in a IOB or BIO format, which is the format that is used in our two multi-intent classification/slot-filling reference models [GL-GIN](https://github.com/yizhen20133868/GL-GIN/tree/master) and [AGIF](https://github.com/LooperXX/AGIF). The data in `intent-slots.yml` is in the form that is accepted by the model [DIET from Rasa](https://rasa.com/blog/introducing-dual-intent-and-entity-transformer-diet-state-of-the-art-performance-on-a-lightweight-architecture/). This is a state-of-the-art model that can be used for multi-intent classification and entity extraction. This is an important distinction. Slots are domain-specific 'variables' that help to contextualize an intent. An example would be "Go find the doctor in room 215" - the intent is to go find and the slots are "doctor" and "room 215". However, there can be other entities that are not associated to slots, if they aren't included in the domain. An example would be "Go find the doctor i saw the other day in room 215, the cardio lab" - if there are no slots for "doctor i saw the other day" and "the cardio lab", these won't be parsed. For a further discussion of this distinction, [see here](https://forum.rasa.com/t/what-is-the-conceptual-relation-between-entities-and-slots/40275/2). Entities are also more complicated, as they may have hierarchical and graphical interactions.
